# docs/

Project documentation. All docs have English and Japanese versions with cross-links.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `usage.md` | Detailed usage guide (English) |
| `usage.ja.md` | Detailed usage guide (Japanese) |
| `requirements.md` | Requirements specification v4 (Japanese, original spec) |

## Notes

- Program output examples in docs must match actual English messages from the source code. When source messages change, update the examples in both `usage.md` and `usage.ja.md`.
- `requirements.md` is the original Japanese specification and is kept as-is for reference. It is not translated.
